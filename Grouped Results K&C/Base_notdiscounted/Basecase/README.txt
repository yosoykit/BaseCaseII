In this folder the results for the Base-Case are implemented, and two additional result scenarios: Including AF and DIfferent Ages

The Template excel files are results that were send in by the different groups.

THe Results_Base.xlsx file links the three template files together, calculates all outcomes and includes the graphs and tables that were 
used in the paper.

Make sure to open the files from the same folder all at once ( link only works when all files are open)
